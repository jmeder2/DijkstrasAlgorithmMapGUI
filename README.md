# Dijkstras Algorithm Map GUI
This is a graphical user interface that allows you to add any cities, and also add roads linking two cities and how long the road is in miles. Finally, the program applies Dijkstra's algorithm to your queries of finding the shortest path between two cities.

First thing to note of all, this program is a GUI application, so make sure you run my submission on a machine that supports graphics.

There are 4 classes in the this folder: 

Calculator.java
City.java
Road.java
Dijkstras.java

Make sure to have them all in the same folder. Dijkstras.java is a runner class, so compile all 4 classes and run Dijkstras to begin my submission.

What you will see is a scrollable list of pre-defined cities, plus the ability to add a new city and add a new road.

You can add any new city, just no cities with duplicate names. And when adding a new road, both cities entered must exist already.

To begin my calculator, simply fill in the initial city in the “City 1” text field, and the destination city in the “City 2” text field and hit the ‘Calculate’ button.

Thank you,
